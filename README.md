# Platformer
Here is my game: Platformer. This my first coded game, so enjoy!

# How to play and aim of the game:
1. You are in a land full of blobs and lava pits, and the aim is to get to the end of the game and collect as many coins possible along the way.
2. At the end of each level is a grey portal. Yoou have to go through this so that you are instantly transported to the next level.
3. If you managed to collide with a blob or fall into a lava pit, there will be a gameover screen and restart button that - once pressed - allows you to redo the level.

# Keys:
Spacebar = Player jumps,
Right key = Player moves right,
Left key = Player moves left,
